## ðŸ“– Project Backstory
This program is actually a part of my final exam project. The lecturer asked us to write a simple program for encrypting and decrypting a text with affine cipher. We also were asked to make our own [documentation](https://github.com/sinatraXX/Affine-Cipher/wiki/%F0%9F%92%A1-Affine-Cipher) on it.
