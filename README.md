# ✨ Affine Cipher ✨
## 📎 Subject: Network Cryptography
## 📖 Project Backstory
This program is actually a part of my final exam project. The lecturer asked us to write a simple program for encrypting a plaintext with affine cipher. We also were asked to crack this cipher and make our own [documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJ0n9NELsnuXXV9H4clOYJj2oYttAbeD/view?usp=sharing) on it. 

## 📝 How to use
Basically you can use this program like any other simple python program. No inputs necessary. You can also change your desired plaintext/ciphertext inside the program. Make sure to have the modules needed in the same directory in order to make the cracking program works.
