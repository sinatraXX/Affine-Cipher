## ðŸ“Ž Subject: Network Cryptography
## ðŸ“– Project Backstory
This program is actually a part of my final exam project. The lecturer asked us to write a simple program for encrypting and decrypting a text with affine cipher. We also were asked to make our own [documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJ0n9NELsnuXXV9H4clOYJj2oYttAbeD/view?usp=sharing) on it.
